# My Career Story
My story starts back when I was in middle school. I was put into a computer class as one of my elective classes. Up until that point, I didn’t have a solid idea of what I wanted to be when I grew up. I played with the idea of being a marine biologist for a while. But that elective class completely changed the trajectory of my life. Suddenly, I fell in love with the concept of making websites and editing photos, videos, and music. In a later class, we even started to learn programming. This continued throughout high school as well. I kept taking computer classes and was even given internship opportunities by my teachers. One internship was at a local government IT center where we were paired with workers who acted like our mentors. The other internship was during the summer at school where we worked with the IT guy to make sure all the computers, tablets, and laptops were ready for the upcoming school year. After that, I graduated from high school and went to FIU to major in IT. One summer, I worked in a summer camp that taught kids basic computer skills and video game techniques. On campus, I’ve been involved in a couple of clubs related to technology and currently, I also work as a tutor for the computer science department there. I am excited to add being a Tech Fellow for CodePath to my career journey.
